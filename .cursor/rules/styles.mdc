# Data Transformation Rules

## API Data Transformation

- Always use `camelize` for transforming backend fields to frontend fields
- Always use `humps.decamelizeKeys` for transforming data to be sent to the backend

## Rationale

This ensures consistent data transformation between the backend (which typically uses snake_case) and frontend (which uses camelCase), maintaining type safety and preventing data corruption.
